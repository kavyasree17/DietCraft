# DietCraft

DietCraft is my web project where I created a personalized 7-day diet planner.  
The website allows users to select their goal (weight loss, muscle gain, or healthy lifestyle) and choose dietary restrictions (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, or none).  
Based on that, it generates a different meal plan for every day with recipes for breakfast, lunch, snacks, and dinner.
